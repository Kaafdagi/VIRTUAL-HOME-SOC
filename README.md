# HOME SOC Setup With Windows,Linux(Pardus) And Splunk

 "This project demonstrates the setup of a home Security Operations Center (SOC) using virtual machines running Windows 10, Pardus, and Kali Linux. The aim is to integrate security tools such as Sysmon, Splunk Forwarder, Splunk Enterprise, and Trend Micro Agent for real-time security monitoring and threat detection."
 
 ##  Technologies and Requirements
-VirtualBox (Installed )
    
-Windows 10: Hosts Sysmon, Splunk Forwarder, and Trend Micro Agent to monitor and forward security logs.

-Splunk Forwarder: Collects log data from Windows 10 and sends it to Splunk Enterprise for analysis.

-Pardus: Hosts Splunk Enterprise to centralize log collection and analysis.

-System Requirements: Specify the minimum system requirements for running these virtual machines, such as 4 GB of RAM and 50 GB of disk space.

## Windows 10 Virtual Machine Installation 

1.Create a new Virtual Machine (VM):
- Open VirtualBox and click on “New” to create a virtual machine. 
   - Name: Windows Server
   - Type: Microsoft Windows
   -Version: Windows 10 (64-bit)

2.Allocate resources:

   - Memory: 4096 MB (4 GB)
   -Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk (at least 50 GB)



3.Mount the Windows Server ISO:

   - Go to the VM settings -> Storage -> Load the Windows Server ISO file.

4.Start the VM and follow the installation steps:

   - Select language, time, and keyboard preferences.
 
  -  Click "Install Now".
 
 - Select the appropriate edition (e.g., Standard with GUI).
   
- Accept the license terms.
 
 - Choose "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)".

 - Select the unallocated space and click "Next" to install.

   ## Installing Sysmon and  Configuration on Windows
   
 1.Download Sysmon:

 - Download Sysmon from the Microsoft Sysinternals website.
 2. Install Sysmon

   - Extract  the Sysmon.zip file  to a folder on your computer.

  3. Open Command Prompt as Administrator

  4. Run Sysmon.exe:

 - Sysmon is a command-line tool, so you’ll need to run it via the Command Prompt. To install Sysmon with a configuration file, use the following command:
```
   sysmon -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml
```
5. Create or download a configuration file:

- The configuration file defines which events Sysmon will monitor.
   
 - You can download a recommended configuration file from SwiftOnSecurity’s GitHub page.

  - Save the sysmonconfig.xml file to the same folder where you extracted Sysmon.
   
6. Verify Sysmon Installation and Operation
 - To check if Sysmon is running correctly, use this command:

  ```
  sysmon -s
```
- This will show the status of Sysmon.

 - To view the event logs generated by Sysmon:

    - Open Event Viewer by searching for it in the Start menu, and navigate to Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon/Operational.

   7.Configuration Sysmon
   
 - Create or download configurations files:

     -  Configuration file from https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config

     -  Copy to file   sysmonconfig-export.xml to the Notepad ++
   
     -  Save the file type of  xml file name florian_config.xml

     -  Configuration file from https://github.com/olaf_harton/sysmon-modular

     - Copy to file sysmonconfig-research.xml To the Notepad++
      
     -  Save the file type of  xml file name Olaf_harton_config.xml
  - Install Sysmon with the config file
    
      - Run the command via CMD as Administrator
   
      - C:\Path of yor files\Downloads\Sysmon>Sysmon64.exe -h
   
      - C:\Path of yor files\Downloads\Sysmon>Sysmon64.exe -c Florian_config.xml
         - To see log on Splunk run whoami command
   
      - C:\Path of yor files\Downloads\Sysmon\Sysmon64.exe -c Olaf_harton_config.xml
   
         - To see log on Splunk run whoami command
